  # NOTE:
  # The idea with automatically adding versions to run_exports doesn't
  # work since we don't want all these dependencies as run deps of all ROS
  # packages. Therefore I am currently manually adding them to run_constrained.
  # This has to be synchronized with our current conda_build_config all the time :(

  #   - ogre
  #   - qt

  # if the upstream package does not have run_exports
  # please change it in the conda_build_config.yaml!

  summary: |
    The ROS distro mutex. To switch between ROS versions, you need to change the mutex.
    E.g. mamba install ros-distro-mutex=*=noetic to switch to noetic.
